I have a ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G16 16" 165Hz Gaming Laptop FHD-Intel 13th Gen Core i7 with 16GB Memory-NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060-512GB SSD - Eclipse Gray. 

I had this problem with my old laptop that my charging port would be visibly plugged in, but it would only sometimes charge. So, as a result, I used the onboard Razer software to change the keyboard brightness whether it was plugged in or on battery. 

Now with this laptop, when I installed fedora, my keyboard backlight didn't work. After trying different things, brightnessctl finally turned my keyboard light on, and I was able to control the brightness on the keyboard, but I wanted to do the same thing with this laptop as I did with my previous laptop. 



Just note: this script will run a systemd service on a timer to update your keyboard backlight brightness based on whether the laptop is plugged in or on battery power. 

You will NOT be able to changed the keyboard brightness, as it will auto update to your power status.
If you want to have your own brightness, you will need to turn the systemd service off.

To do this:
systemctl stop keyboard_backlight.service

This script is extremely simple and elementary, not to mention it's my first.
Thanks for reading.
